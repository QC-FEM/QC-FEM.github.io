# Official QC-FEM Website

Welcome to QC-FEM's official website. This is expected to be one of the main communication channels of the group to its audience. At this stage, it is no more than a blueprint. This site is built using **Jekyll**, and so, must of the files are automatically generated. The main source for tools on how to build a GitHub website is the YouTube series from [Bill Raymond](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo4JslyQelQ&list=PLWzwUIYZpnJuT0sH4BN56P5oWTdHJiTNq&index=5).

**IMPORTANT:** Any contributor must see at least the first 3 videos on this series.

 The structure is based upon the main projects of the group for 2021:

* Publication of a Quantum Computing Crash Course.
* Publication of Investigation Projects.

To this end, the website is going to have, at least for now, two blogs, called **Crash Course** and **Projects**. The contents of the posts are somewhat self-explanatory. The Crash Course blog is expected to contain detailed scripts and links to lessons on 2021-1 course given by the group at National University of Colombia. On the other hand, the Projects Blog is expected to contain posts regarding the advances in the execution of investigation projects inside the group.
